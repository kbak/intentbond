# Intent and specifications

Capture user outcomes and rationale as intent, and concrete behavior, constraints,
and design as a specification. Use the project's existing Markdown documents;
`intent.md` and `spec.md` are useful defaults. Give the selected outcomes and
requirements OpenFastTrace (OFT) IDs and link them to related design, code, and
tests so later changes can be checked and reviewed.

Keep authored property statements, shared model definitions, interface contracts,
assumptions, evidence links and unresolved verification work in the specification,
beside the requirements they refine or in referenced sections. Outcomes and
rationale belong in the intent document. Use headings and stable anchors as the
documents grow; preserve established project organization and surviving OFT IDs.
Native tests, solver models, proof sources and generated evidence remain separate
linked artifacts. This does not require another document hierarchy, a property
JSON schema, or new CLI fields; tool-managed recovery records remain required.

Use the shared [concepts and result meanings](semantics.md), included alongside this guidance
in agent contexts. Keep coverage, origin, approval and execution evidence distinct.

Normal checks read root scope.json from the adopted baseline; omit --scope to
use it. Use external scope only when supplied by the caller. Candidate scope
edits cannot authorize themselves; proposed starting requirements and scope need review before use.

## Capture intent from a conversation

Retain the user's problem, desired outcome, affected people, high-level constraints,
and reasons for decisions in their terms. Preserve useful alternatives and open
questions without turning every suggestion into a promise. Label an agent's
interpretation as inferred until the user resolves it. An implementation's current
behavior alone does not establish the user's intent.

Write intent and specifications as current product documents: state the desired
outcomes, decisions and reasons directly. Avoid dated attributions, conversation
recaps and migration histories in the maintained narrative. Link a discussion,
ticket or decision record when it helps explain a current choice; do not invent
quotations or provenance. Keep proposals and open questions explicit, and update
the current account when an authorized decision changes the desired outcome.

Give each decision or contract one authoritative home in the existing documents.
Update that text and link to it from overviews, architecture and task notes instead
of repeating its detailed scope or delivery status. Keep conditions needed to
understand a claim beside the claim. Name a decision's meaning when citing its ID
and link its definition so readers need not reconstruct an issue conversation.
Use a small documentation map when ownership is otherwise unclear; no new document
is required. Preserve stable IDs, useful anchors and source provenance when consolidating.

## Link intent to the specification

Use stable IDs for independently meaningful outcomes. For example, an intent item
can be written as:

```markdown
### End access to abandoned sessions
`intent~abandoned-sessions~1`

People should not leave an unattended account accessible indefinitely.

Needs: req
```

The specification selects concrete behavior and links it to that outcome:

```markdown
### Inactivity timeout
`req~session-expiration~1`

A session expires when its inactivity reaches 30 minutes. A session with less
than 30 minutes of inactivity remains active.

Covers:
- `intent~abandoned-sessions~1`

Needs: impl, utest
```

Use backticks around IDs in `Covers` lists as well as declarations. OFT accepts
them, and they keep GitHub Markdown from interpreting the tildes as strikethrough.

Code and test annotations keep referencing the requirement. The 30-minute choice
belongs to the specification; its rationale can be retained with the decision.
An optional implementation plan references the affected items and intended checks.
Do not use `Covers` for a conversation citation or a plan's task list: those are
source/context references, not declarations of requirement coverage.

Include the intent and specification documents in the trusted scope's `inputs`
and `specification_paths` so tracing and review see both. An adopted
`required_coverage` floor of `"intent": ["req"]` preserves the declared obligation;
keep the existing requirement coverage floors too. Such a floor requires links
for declared items, not completeness of captured intent. Plain Markdown links
provide navigation but do not satisfy OFT coverage. No new CLI or artifact schema
is needed, and existing document names and OFT type conventions remain valid.

## Author requirements and design

Read the trusted scope and relevant repository guidance. Use existing headings,
capability tables or targeted searches to locate affected requirements, then read
their full promises and acceptance criteria and follow links to code and tests.
Reuse supplied context; retrieve more only to resolve a gap. Flag uncertainty:
trace links support consistency assessment but do not prove semantic agreement.

Distinguish exploration, proposed and agreed requirements, and open questions.
Formalize concrete, testable promises when useful; brainstorming is not agreement.
For changed promises, summarize the ID, before → after behavior, reason and
affected acceptance checks in the existing task or PR. Flag contradictions and
unknown rationale instead of inventing intent. Reuse this summary in the handoff.
For authorized mid-task revisions, reconcile affected design, code and assertions
through their links; preserve work and decisions that still apply.

Reuse OFT names for continuing promises. Search before assigning a new unique
name and initial revision. Follow the project's revision policy; editorial edits
and document moves need not increase the revision unless that policy requires it.

Use existing Markdown structure, OFT types and Needs/Covers chains; preserve
design/architecture links. Put meaningful rationale and rejected alternatives
in existing task/design notes when useful. Keep intended files within the
specification paths; flag scope conflicts instead of silently expanding them.

For critical or ambiguous rules, optionally add a logical statement beside the
requirement's prose and ID. Define its domain (variables, types, units), assumptions,
and guarantee, including quantifiers and relevant state or time boundaries. Use
preconditions, postconditions, invariants, or temporal properties as appropriate;
do not require every requirement to have a formula. Follow the
[property-testing guidance](../../property-testing/SKILL.md). Keep assumptions and
test-search limits distinct from promised behavior. Conflicting prose and logic
need a review decision, and a stronger precondition or narrower domain can weaken
the promise. A textual formula is not proof or evidence that a test ran.

When establishing or substantively reviewing these rules, use the
[property discovery and review pass](../../property-testing/SKILL.md#discover-and-review-properties).
Derive the intended guarantee independently of implementation choices, examine
boundary outcomes and retained assumptions, and check whether component properties
can all hold while the intended outcome fails. Keep proposed definitions and
uninspected or uncovered behavior visible in the specification. Approval status
and evidence status are separate: distinguish a proposed check, an executed search
and a proved statement with its assumptions and source correspondence.

Carry agreed text, IDs/revisions, acceptance criteria, documentation paths and
authorized promise changes into the existing handoff. Keep unapproved proposals
and unresolved questions separate. No extra document, planning pass or approval
step is required; drafting does not authorize implementation or scope changes.

## Keep independently evolving promises distinct

Choose stable IDs for independently reviewable behavior (for example ordering,
visibility, retry timing and errors), rather than requiring every consumer of a
large umbrella interface declaration to acknowledge every change. Avoid splitting
sentences mechanically. Multiple clauses can define the outcomes, exceptions or
invariants of one operation. When a change affects one promise independently of
the others, assess whether separate IDs would let their wording and assertions
evolve independently while preserving the accepted obligations.
For an intentional split, record the old ID/revision,
successor IDs, preserved obligations, authorized changes and migrated consumers;
keep one authoritative active set and preserve history separately. Advancing a
reference requires review of continued assertion coverage, never just a bulk bump.
Use `ib impact --evidence PATH` to inspect derived declaration/edge changes and,
for new bundles, source-line categories. Metadata-only revision changes do not
establish semantic adequacy or reduced review effort.
