name: intentbond
description: Capture intent, draft specifications, or implement and review a task with OpenFastTrace, using the supplied scope and baseline to follow linked documentation, code, tests, and evidence.
---

Maintain intent, specification requirements, code, tests, and their links
in each commit prepared for the task.
Compare changes with the agreed starting commit and retain check results for review.

Use the [concepts and result meanings](references/semantics.md) from the matching tool
package or the copy included in context. Apply its distinctions in the existing
task summary; no separate report is required. For user conversations, design
discussions, or changes to intent and specifications, use
[authoring guidance](references/requirements.md).
Discussion does not authorize implementation.

## Task context

Reuse supplied instructions, requirement context, and matching local/package/factory
tooling. Read missing context as needed; do not reread supplied text merely to
follow this workflow. Honor pinned revisions and preserve local changes.
If tooling is missing, follow the [standalone setup](references/setup.md).

Retain the target repository's absolute path. Use the supplied scope and baseline;
in standalone use, the CLI defaults to the repository's adopted scope.json and
merge base with the locally known default branch (HEAD on that branch or detached
HEAD). Use an explicit baseline for work based on another feature/release branch.
Resolve and retain the starting baseline before editing or committing. Reuse it
for checking the intended change and verifying its committed result; resolving
the default again after a commit on the default branch would select the new HEAD
and omit the change from the comparison.
Ask only about unresolved task or scope decisions. If the project lacks starting
requirements and links, use [the existing-project skill](../recover-baseline/SKILL.md)
to document them. Continue implementation when already authorized, retaining the
recovery evidence and reviewing the combined change through the existing workflow.
Ordinary development does not repeat that initial work. Candidate scope edits
cannot authorize their own policy.

Locate affected promises through existing headings, capability tables or targeted
searches; read their full text and follow links back to intent and through design,
code and assertions. Preserve relevant conversation decisions and unresolved
questions when maintaining intent; a proposal is not an accepted promise.
When saved evidence is available, assemble missing context for known IDs together:

```sh
ib explain 'req~first~1' 'req~second~1' --compact --evidence /path/to/check/evidence.json
```

This shares metadata and linked locations without rerunning tests. Use
`--format json` for structured IDs or `--snapshot base` for historical items. Saved evidence
does not establish current-source agreement or complete impact coverage. Follow
indirect links as needed; query only to resolve gaps, not as a required final step.
For a nondefault OFT installation, keep `INTENTBOND_OFT_JAR` set or pass `--oft-jar`
to `explain` as well as `check`; saved evidence does not configure the local JAR path.

## Implementation and review

Keep IDs beside the relevant behavior and assertions; follow the scope's coverage
and revision policy. Do not weaken promises or remove obligations to hide failures.
Keep prose and test edits visible. Authorized edits can proceed without another
confirmation; conflicts with approved requirements need a decision through the
caller's question or review process. Candidate approval files grant no authority.

Follow affected obligations to existing properties and maintain their assertions,
generators and assumptions with the change. For selected new checks or properties
identified while documenting the project, use the matching packaged
[property-testing skill](../property-testing/SKILL.md), or its supplied inline
copy. It strengthens selected obligations with ordinary executable tests and
uses the existing review/evidence flow; it does not require property tests for
every change. Load only the applicable framework guide.

Before each commit or final handoff, review the full intended Git diff, including
new files. Start from each substantive behavior change and its boundary cases,
then follow the relevant requirements, implementation and test assertions; do not
start and stop with the links that already exist. Include related unchanged
promises and keep supporting documentation consistent. Existing relationships can
suffice; unchanged promises need no wording or ID edits, and individual files or
functions need no arbitrary annotations. Check whether the implementation satisfies
the promise and the assertions verify the affected behavior. Code-only changes
need this assessment too. Use focused source reads around the links.
For substantial semantic changes, ask whether the specification itself admits a
case the intended system forbids, or excludes a required successful case. Look
for a small counterexample using independent source examples, a reference
implementation or another suitable oracle; account for its assumptions and known
departures. Proofs and tests derived from the same specification can share an
omission. Preserve useful counterexamples as regressions and resolve conflicting
meanings through the existing review. This is a focused review prompt, not a
mandatory new tool or validation pass; see the [example](references/semantics.md#independent-semantic-checks).
After a repair, inspect its delta and affected relationships; repeat a full
review if the repair changes the scope or invalidates earlier conclusions.

In the existing task summary, state what you checked, reuse or update the handoff's
requirement-change summary, and flag contradictions, gaps and uncertainty with
IDs and file references. This is best-effort review; structural checks do not
establish semantic agreement or assertion adequacy.

## Run checks and report the result

Use `ib impact --evidence PATH` to inspect changed-file artifact membership,
native coverage gaps, required execution gaps and immediate-link hubs. A file
without imported artifacts is an inspection cue, not proof of a missing requirement.
Keep default revision enforcement optional; strict imported-content revision
policy also applies to editorial edits. Use trusted `review_paths` for implementation
roots when code-only changes should leave review pending.

For an interrupted or larger review, optionally create a worklist with
`ib review start --repo ROOT --evidence PATH --out NEW_DIRECTORY`. Use `ib review
next`, `record` and `status` with `--worklist DIRECTORY`; record an exact task ID,
`--state reviewed|deferred|pending` and a meaningful `-m` note. Deferred items remain
incomplete. The plan covers changed files and immediate graph neighbors, so keep
reading affected behavior beyond those links. Every resume matches current source
and trusted policy. After a repair, run a fresh check and start a fresh worklist;
old notes remain references, not completion of the new change. Progress is unsigned
local accounting and never clears semantic review or supplies an assurance approval.
See [development review](../../../docs/development-review.md) in the source checkout
for full commands; installed packages retain these command instructions.

When the supplied scope enables `tests.execution_links`, review affected test
artifacts and their execution associations without waiting for an explicit user
request. Check the artifact declarations, runner mappings or JUnit `oft_id`
properties, and recorded outcomes together. Maintain `required_artifacts` for
tests whose passing execution is mandatory; not every test needs a link. Inspect
`tests.format` before choosing a runner; see [execution links](references/execution-links.md)
for pytest and unittest producers. Propose missing configuration/producer work
separately from unsupported capability; changing trusted policy still follows
the caller's authority.

Run the configured check on the completed candidate and again after repairs:

```sh
ib check --repo /path/to/repo
```

Use explicit task inputs when supplied:

```sh
ib check --repo /path/to/repo --scope /path/to/trusted-scope.json \
  --base BASE_COMMIT --candidate worktree --out /path/to/new-evidence
```

`python -m intentbond` is equivalent. The runtime requires Git,
Java, OFT and the project's test dependencies. Each output directory must be new
and outside the repository. Retain the actual baseline commit, exit code and
complete bundle. Start with the printed status, counts, diagnostics and artifact
paths. Open detailed logs/reports for failures or unresolved questions; success
does not require dumping every retained artifact into context. The check already
runs the configured tests; repeat them separately only for a concrete need.
For long checks, add `--progress` to follow retained test output on stderr. The
final output shows recorded trace-command and test durations separately; those
timings do not measure agent effort or all checking overhead.

Inspect required changes in review.json. review.patch contains changes selected
by specification_paths, test_paths and optional review_paths; it need not duplicate
a review already covering those edits or contain the full candidate diff.
Exit 0 passes automation; exit 4 leaves semantic review pending.
Other exits cannot establish completion. Repair in-scope failures;
report prerequisite or baseline defects without bypassing policy. Changed source
requires a fresh check; an earlier passing bundle cannot replace a failed run.

Suite success does not establish execution of each linked test. With the optional
[execution-link profile](references/execution-links.md), preserve missing, skipped
and ambiguous observations. A reported passing execution is not proof of requirement
satisfaction. An explain exit 0 means inspection succeeded, not validation passed.

Once the change is committed or exported to another checkout, verify that commit
with the original baseline:

```sh
ib verify --repo /path/to/repo --base BASE_COMMIT --candidate EXPORTED_COMMIT \
  --evidence /path/to/new-evidence/evidence.json
```

Add the same --scope if one was supplied. For exit-4 evidence, use
--allow-pending-review only when the caller enforces review before acceptance;
verification leaves it pending. Recheck changed contents. Follow the existing
Git/review process; this skill does not itself authorize publishing or acceptance.
Report the exact evidence path and a concise assessment. Completion requires
matching current source, successful checks and the caller's review gates.
